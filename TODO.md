* Make sure regex works in almost all cases (including trailing/preceeding characters)
* Create a settings page which allows for adding/removing regex entries.
* Add Functionality to pause NoPolitics.
* Make NoPolitics work on only certain websites (Add settings for what websites, default facebook, twitter, G+)
* Add functionality to replace entire text nodes in which there is a match with pictures of cats/kittens from flikr API. (This will require probably moving from just searching the plaintext innertext of the website to searching the DOM for search/replace)
